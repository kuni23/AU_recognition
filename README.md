# AU_recognition
This repo presents the codes utilized during my master thesis work, so it includes the codes implemented by me. However, some parts are not uploaded to the repository, which I only leveraged for my project (database creation, facial cropping, facial detection). As well, it includes images from the in-the-wild test set, which are examined during an extensive error analyis.
